              <p>My fondness for them might be born of the comfort earned by hours of repeated creation (I’ve made a great many maps). It might be the simplicity of them – data shown as map overlays is immediately understandable to pretty much everyone. It might be their versatility, the potential expression for geographic data is limited only by your own creativity and tolerance for frustration. Most likely, those factors combined with a tendency towards topical data products is what inspired the idea behind ‘The Catastrophe Coefficient’.</p>

              <p>Our goal was to roughly predict which areas in the US would have an increased likelihood of wildfires as the effects of climate change intensify throughout the 21st century. We would then display our predictions in a transparent map layer, akin to a heatmap, wherever we had climate data. Our ideal product would cover the continental United States, but if necessary we were willing to settle for the Western US.</p>

              <p>First, our fire needed a spark. Ignition came in the form of a dataset created by the U.S. Geological Survey Forest and Rangeland Ecosystem Science Center. They created a shapefile with polygons covering the area of every wildfire on record from 1870-2015 across eight states. We loaded the shapefile into R, selected only wildfires that occurred from 1960-2000, and converted the polygons to a raster format spatially consistent with the Worldclim data. We overlaid these data layers, with the climate values with the wildfires expressed as 1/0 presence/absence data, and exported the dataframe from R into a Pandas dataframe in Python.</p>

            <div class="col">

              <p>Goals defined, we set out to gather data. Thankfully, climate data was readily accessible in the form of raster layers from the Worldclim datasets. Worldclim.org maintains a staggering amount of climate data for the entire world as layers of data values mapped to pixels corresponding to specific squares of geographic area. Data are available for multiple different time frames including a ‘current’ dataset representing conditions from 1960 to 1990, future datasets with ranges centered around 2050 and 2070, and interestingly enough a dataset detailing climate condition in the late Holocene period! The data comes in varying resolutions, from 900mx900m pixels to 18.6kmx18.6km pixels. Perhaps arrogantly, we elected to use the highest resolution available..</p>

              <h2 class="mb-3 mt-5">An uncommon problem, and an enthusiastic solution</h2>

              <p>I haven’t told you about the group behind the alliterative wonder that is The Catastrophe Coefficient. There were six of us – Chris Campbell, Babek Sandhar, Harpreet Singh, Sandeep Palavalasa, Paul Song, and myself. Six was the maximum group size allowed, and the five of them had languished as I laboriously compiled our master dataset. Suddenly we all had the ability to get down to business and we ran into a problem I had never experienced before in group project work – we all felt that we hadn’t contributed enough to the project and wanted to make up for it by doing as much as we possibly could. However, the final product only required a model, a database, and a rough skeleton to house it. Not nearly enough for six groupmates motivated by ability and guilt.</p>
              <p>Thankfully, a solution quickly presented itself.</p>
              <p>Rather than limit ourselves to one model and subsequent prediction, why not leverage our abundance of members and fit every model we can think of? Our final product wouldn’t just be a wildfire prediction, it would also allow us to compare and contrast different machine learning algorithms in an easily digestible format.</p>
              <p>In the end, we fit a Neural Network, a Random Forests, a K Nearest-Neighbors, and a Logistic Regression. We output four series of predictions for each model, for each of the two future timeframes (2050 and 2070) and for two different projections of future rates of climate change. The first projection was a more likely ‘moderate’ projection, the second a more ‘severe’ projection which could be described using only mild exaggeration as a Doomsday scenario.</p>
              <p>Predictions in hand we set out to host the data externally and figure out the best way to go about our mapping. That’s where a minor annoyance crystallized into a major problem.</p>

              <h2 class= 'mb-3 mt-5'>What do you mean, our 16 million rows of data aren’t loading quickly? Does the Cloud need more wind?</h2>
              <p>Remember our potentially arrogant choice to use the highest resolution data possible? Yeah, that backfired. What we gained in precision we lost in actual usability of the data. Loading a separate data value for every square kilometer in the continental U.S. every time a user wanted to see a different model’s prediction was not a viable path. It wasn’t even a viable path to load predictions for a single model – the map took 20 minutes to load in the first place!</p>
              <p>In the future, we intend to revisit the project with lower resolution data to see if we can accomplish the initial goal of a countrywide map. However, with the deadline looming ever closer, we decided to restrict our predictions to the western US, and to randomly reduce the data we had by 6/7ths. That left us a usable amount of data, and while it wildly increased the inaccuracy of the analysis, it did provide us with a viable proof of concept. At long last, our maps were complete!</p>
